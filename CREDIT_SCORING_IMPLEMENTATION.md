# Credit Scoring System Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive credit scoring system to the BigBankApp that impacts users' credit scores based on various financial transactions and behaviors. The system hooks into all major transaction types including:

- Bank transactions (transfers, withdrawals, deposits)
- Loan payments and management
- Gem trading (buying/selling)
- Stock transactions (buying/selling)

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ICreditScoringService** - Interface defining credit scoring operations
2. **CreditScoringService** - Main implementation with sophisticated algorithms
3. **CreditScoringProxyService** - Proxy for desktop app communication
4. **CreditScoreController** - API endpoints for credit scoring operations

### Integration Points

The credit scoring system is integrated into the following services:

- `BankTransactionService` - Hooks into all bank transactions
- `LoanService` - Tracks loan applications, payments, and completions
- `StoreService` - Monitors gem trading behavior
- `TransactionService` - Analyzes stock trading patterns

## Credit Score Calculation Algorithms

### Bank Transactions

**Transfer Impact:**
- Small transfers (< 10% of income): +1 to +2 points
- Large transfers (> 50% of income): -5 points
- Excessive transaction frequency (> 50/month): -2 points

**Withdrawal Impact:**
- Frequent large withdrawals: -3 points
- More than 10 withdrawals per month: -3 points
- Withdrawals > 30% of income: -3 points

**Deposit Impact:**
- Regular deposits show financial stability: +1 to +5 points
- Larger deposits (> 10% of income): +5 points

### Loan Management

**Payment Impact:**
- On-time payments: +15 points
- Extra payments beyond minimum: +5 additional points
- 6+ consecutive on-time payments: +10 bonus points
- Late payments: -25 points
- 30+ days late: -15 additional penalty
- 7-30 days late: -10 additional penalty

**Loan Lifecycle:**
- New loan application: -5 points (initial debt impact)
- Loan completion: +20 points (or +10 if previously overdue)
- Loan becomes overdue: -30 points

### Gem Trading

**Purchase Behavior:**
- Small purchases (< 5% of income): +1 point
- Large purchases (> 5% of income): Calculated risk-based penalty
- Excessive gem buying (> 20% of income/month): -8 points

**Risk Calculation Formula:**
```
riskFactor = (transactionValue / income) + (gemAmount / 1000)
impact = baseImpact * min(2.0, riskFactor)
```

**Sale Behavior:**
- Selling gems: Generally neutral to slightly positive (+1 to +2 points)
- Large sales (> 50% of balance): +2 points (may indicate cash need)

### Stock Trading

**Investment Behavior:**
- Portfolio diversity: +1 to +5 points based on unique stocks
- Reasonable investments (< 15% of income): +3 points
- High-risk investments (> 50% of income): -5 points

**Trading Patterns:**
- Profitable sales: +2 points
- Day trading (> 10 trades/week): -3 points (excessive risk)

## Comprehensive Credit Score Calculation

The system uses a weighted approach similar to real credit scoring:

1. **Payment History (35%)** - Based on loan payment patterns
2. **Credit Utilization (30%)** - Balance vs. income ratio
3. **Credit History Length (15%)** - Time since first credit activity
4. **Credit Mix (10%)** - Variety of credit types (loans, investments)
5. **New Credit (10%)** - Recent loan applications

### Score Ranges

- **Minimum Score:** 300
- **Maximum Score:** 850
- **Default Score:** 650 (for new users)

## Implementation Details

### Service Registration

The credit scoring service is registered in the dependency injection container:

```csharp
// In BankApi/Program.cs
builder.Services.AddScoped<ICreditScoringService, CreditScoringService>();
```

### Transaction Hooks

Each transaction service now includes credit score impact calculations:

```csharp
// Example from BankTransactionService
await ApplyCreditScoreImpactAsync(transaction);
```

### Error Handling

The system is designed to be resilient:
- Credit score calculation errors don't fail transactions
- Errors are logged but don't interrupt business operations
- Default scores are used when calculations fail

## API Endpoints

The system exposes REST endpoints for credit scoring operations:

- `POST /api/creditscore/bank-transaction-impact/{userCnp}`
- `POST /api/creditscore/loan-payment-impact/{userCnp}`
- `POST /api/creditscore/gem-transaction-impact/{userCnp}`
- `POST /api/creditscore/stock-transaction-impact/{userCnp}`
- `POST /api/creditscore/update/{userCnp}`
- `GET /api/creditscore/current/{userCnp}`
- `GET /api/creditscore/comprehensive/{userCnp}`

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Credit Score Updates

Credit scores are automatically updated when users:
- Make bank transfers or deposits
- Pay loans on time or late
- Buy or sell gems
- Trade stocks
- Complete or default on loans

### Manual Credit Score Calculation

```csharp
// Get current credit score
int currentScore = await creditScoringService.GetCurrentCreditScoreAsync(userCnp);

// Calculate comprehensive score
int comprehensiveScore = await creditScoringService.CalculateComprehensiveCreditScoreAsync(userCnp);

// Update credit score with reason
await creditScoringService.UpdateCreditScoreAsync(userCnp, newScore, "Manual adjustment");
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration** - Use ML models for more sophisticated risk assessment
2. **Real-time Monitoring** - Add real-time credit score monitoring and alerts
3. **Credit Score Trends** - Implement trending analysis and predictions
4. **External Data Integration** - Connect with external credit bureaus
5. **Personalized Recommendations** - Provide users with credit improvement suggestions

## Testing Considerations

When testing the credit scoring system:

1. **Transaction Volume Testing** - Test with high transaction volumes
2. **Edge Case Testing** - Test with extreme values and edge cases
3. **Performance Testing** - Ensure credit calculations don't slow down transactions
4. **Data Consistency** - Verify credit scores remain consistent across operations
5. **Error Recovery** - Test system behavior when credit calculations fail

## Security Considerations

- Credit score calculations are performed server-side only
- User CNP validation is required for all operations
- Credit score history is maintained for audit purposes
- API endpoints should be properly authenticated and authorized

## Monitoring and Logging

The system includes comprehensive logging for:
- Credit score changes and reasons
- Calculation errors and exceptions
- Transaction impacts and patterns
- System performance metrics

This implementation provides a robust, scalable credit scoring system that enhances the banking application with realistic financial behavior tracking and credit assessment capabilities.
